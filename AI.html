        machines that are capable of executing a broad range of tasks that
        typically need human intelligence and reasoning capabilities.

        Scientists and researchers beleive that the human thought process will
        remain a mystery, so it is doubtful that they will be able to create
        machines that think like humans sooner or later.<br />Stephen Hawking
        feared that a well-developed full artificial intellgence could spell the
        end of the human race. <br /><br />
