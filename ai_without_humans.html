            Although AI have created fascinating intelligent machines that can
            replace humans, but they are miles away from matching the human
            brain’s potential.

        <div class="body1">
          <p>
            AI can’t make logical judgements like us although they are trained
            to imitate human behavior.

            Moreover, AI machines lack common sense; they can’t understand the
            “cause and effect” notion. Whereas humans have the ability to
            comprehend and apply what they learned using logical, reasoned, and
            emotional approach.

          <p>
            AI cannot question their existence as humans do, nor can AI explain
            their decisions as humans do. These questions tied to philosophy and
            free will are not in AI’s zone of reach.

        <div class="body1">
          <p>
            AI cannot create safe and moral self-driving cars. Automotive
            companies are all in the chase of self-driven vehicles.

        <div class="body1">
          <p>
            AI cannot bring inventions. AI can follow rules; it cannot create
            from scratch like humans. Humans can invent scientific tools,
            compose songs, and mathematical theorems.
