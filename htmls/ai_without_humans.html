        <p>
          Although AI have created fascinating intelligent machines that can
          replace humans, but they are miles away from matching the human
          brain’s potential.
        </p>

        <p>
          AI can’t make logical judgements like us although they are trained to
          imitate human behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
          Moreover, AI machines lack common sense; they can’t understand the
          “cause and effect” notion. Whereas humans have the ability to
          comprehend and apply what they learned using logical, reasoned, and
          emotional approach.
